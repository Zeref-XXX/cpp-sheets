Given a circular integer array arr[], the task is to determine the next greater element (NGE) for each element in the array.  
The next greater element of an element arr[i] is the first element that is greater than arr[i] when traversing circularly. If no such element exists, return -1 for that position.  
Circular Property:  
Since the array is circular, after reaching the last element, the search continues from the beginning until we have looked at all elements once.
